*Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering*
This project applies unsupervised learning to perform customer segmentation based on spending habits. By grouping similar customers, businesses can create targeted marketing strategies and better understand consumer behavior.

*Files Included*
Customer Segmentation.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing the full project implementation.
Mall_Customers.csv – Dataset used (you may need to upload this if not already in the repo).
README.md – You're here!

*Project Overview*
This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to divide customers into distinct segments based on:
Annual Income
Spending Score

Clustering helps to identify customer groups such as:
High income & high spenders
Low income & high spenders
Average spenders, etc.

*Tech Stack*
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn

*Steps Covered*
Importing the dataset
EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Summary statistics
Visualization using scatter plots & histograms
Choosing the optimal number of clusters using WCSS & Elbow Method
Applying K-Means clustering
Visualizing the clusters

*Output*
Elbow curve to choose number of clusters
2D visualization of clusters and centroids
Clustered customer groups (color-coded)

*Dataset Information*
The dataset contains the following columns:
CustomerID
Gender
Age
Annual Income (k$)
Spending Score (1–100)

*Learning Objectives*
Understand and apply unsupervised learning
Gain experience with clustering algorithms
Perform customer behavior analysis
Use the elbow method to choose k clusters
