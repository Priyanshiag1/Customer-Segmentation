**Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**
This project applies unsupervised learning to perform customer segmentation based on spending habits. By grouping similar customers, businesses can create targeted marketing strategies and better understand consumer behavior.

**Files Included**
Customer Segmentation.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing the full project implementation.

Mall_Customers.csv – Dataset used (you may need to upload this if not already in the repo).

README.md – You're here!

**Project Overview**
This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to divide customers into distinct segments based on:

Annual Income,Spending Score

Clustering helps to identify customer groups such as:
High income & high spenders,Low income & high spenders,Average spenders, etc.

**Tech Stack**
1)Python

2)Pandas

3)NumPy

4)Matplotlib

5)Seaborn

6)Scikit-learn

**Steps Covered**
1)Importing the dataset
2)EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
3)Summary statistics
4)Visualization using scatter plots & histograms
5)Choosing the optimal number of clusters using WCSS & Elbow Method
6)Applying K-Means clustering
7)Visualizing the clusters

**Output**
1)Elbow curve to choose number of clusters

2)2D visualization of clusters and centroids

3)Clustered customer groups (color-coded)

**Dataset Information**
The dataset contains the following columns:
CustomerID,Gender,Age,Annual Income (k$),Spending Score (1–100)

**Learning Objectives**
Understand and apply unsupervised learning
Gain experience with clustering algorithms
Perform customer behavior analysis
Use the elbow method to choose k clusters
