##Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project applies unsupervised learning to perform customer segmentation based on spending habits. By grouping similar customers, businesses can create targeted marketing strategies and better understand consumer behavior.

📁 Files Included
Customer Segmentation.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing the full project implementation.

Mall_Customers.csv – Dataset used (you may need to upload this if not already in the repo).

README.md – You're here!

📌 Project Overview
This project uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to divide customers into distinct segments based on:

Annual Income

Spending Score

Clustering helps to identify customer groups such as:

High income & high spenders

Low income & high spenders

Average spenders, etc.

🛠️ Tech Stack
