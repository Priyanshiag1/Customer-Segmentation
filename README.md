**Customer Segmentation using K-Means and Aggolmerative Hierarchical Clustering**
This project applies unsupervised learning to perform customer segmentation based on spending habits. By grouping similar customers, businesses can create targeted marketing strategies and better understand consumer behavior.

**Files Included**
Customer Segmentation.ipynb – Jupyter notebook containing the full project implementation.

Mall_Customers.csv – Dataset used (you may need to upload this if not already in the repo).

README.md – You're here!

**Project Overview**
This project uses the K-Means and Aggolmerative Hierarchical clustering algorithm to divide customers into distinct segments based on:

Annual Income,Spending Score

Clustering helps to identify customer groups such as:
High income & high spenders,Low income & high spenders,Average spenders, etc.

**Tech Stack**
1)Python

2)Pandas

3)NumPy

4)Matplotlib

5)Seaborn

6)Scikit-learn

7)Scipy (for hierarchical clustering)

**Steps Covered**
1)Importing the dataset

2)EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

3)Summary statistics

4)Visualization using scatter plots & histograms

5)Choosing optimal clusters:

For K-Means: WCSS & Elbow Method

For Hierarchical Clustering: Dendrogram analysis

Applying clustering:

K-Means Clustering

Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

Visualizing the resulting clusters:

2D scatter plots

Dendrogram (for Hierarchical)


**Output**
1)Elbow Curve (for K-Means) to determine optimal k

2)Dendrogram (for Hierarchical Clustering) to visualize cluster hierarchy

3)2D visualization of customer clusters

4)Clustered groups with meaningful color-coding


**Dataset Information**
The dataset contains the following columns:
CustomerID,Gender,Age,Annual Income (k$),Spending Score (1–100)

**Learning Objectives**
Understand and apply unsupervised learning

Compare K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering methods

Visualize and evaluate cluster quality

Perform real-world customer segmentation analysis
